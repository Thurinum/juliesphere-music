## What this is
A truly enlightening Angular assignment which may or may not contain a bunch of silly furry jokes.  

- Uses the Angular framework for UI
- Uses Angular Material
- Uses Spotify's API to query artists
- Add artists to favorites, saved in localstorage
- View artists' concerts with Bandsintown's and Google Maps' APIs
- Play tracks from YouTube using the YouTube API
- Has i18n in 4 languages!

## How to run
```powershell
npm install
ng serve --open
```

## Next steps
Stop using Angular, or any web frameworks, and install Qt.
